To run:

run `npm install` in command line, followed by `ng serve`.  Must have `node` installed to run the first command, and must have `@angular/cli` for the second command.  

Current Features:

- Reactive Form field with basic validation for adding 'friends'
- Dynamic table that displays friends as they are added.  
- Internal:  Ngrx data store that allows components to remain stateless.

TODO:
- Visualize friend data as it is added using D3.js library.  
- Other features?
